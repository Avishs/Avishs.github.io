abstract: Estimates of emissions and energy consumption by vehicular fleet in India
  are not backed by reliable values of parameters, leading to large uncertainties.
  We report new methods, including primary surveys and secondary data sources, to
  estimate in-use fleet size, annual mileage (kilometers per year), and fuel efficiency
  of cars and motorised two-wheelers (MTW) for Delhi, and except fleet size and annual
  mileage of cars, for Visakhapatnam and Rajkot. We estimated that the official number
  of registered cars and MTW in Indian cities is more than two times the actual number
  of in-use vehicles. The private vehicular fleet in India is the youngest, its fuel
  efficiency one of the highest, and annual kilometers travelled is the lowest, compared
  to many high-income countries, such as the USA and those in European Union. Along
  with high renewal rate of fleet, the data suggest that it is possible for India
  to have one of the most fuel-efficient vehicle fleets in the world in the future,
  if fuel-efficiency standards and fiscal policies to contain growing dieselization
  are implemented in the country at the earliest.
