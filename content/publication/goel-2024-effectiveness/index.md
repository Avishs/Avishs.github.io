abstract: "Abstract Background Road Traffic injuries (RTI) are among the top ten leading
  causes of death in the world resulting in 1.35 million deaths every year, about
  93% of which occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite several
  global resolutions to reduce traffic injuries, they have continued to grow in many
  countries. Many high-income countries have successfully reduced RTI by using a public
  health approach and implementing evidence-based interventions. As many LMICs develop
  their highway infrastructure, adopting a similar scientific approach towards road
  safety is crucial. The evidence also needs to be evaluated to assess external validity
  because measures that have worked in high-income countries may not translate equally
  well to other contexts. An evidence gap map for RTI is the first step towards understanding
  what evidence is available, from where, and the key gaps in knowledge. Objectives
  The objective of this evidence gap map (EGM) is to identify existing evidence from
  all effectiveness studies and systematic reviews related to road safety interventions.
  In addition, the EGM identifies gaps in evidence where new primary studies and systematic
  reviews could add value. This will help direct future research and discussions based
  on systematic evidence towards the approaches and interventions which are most effective
  in the road safety sector. This could enable the generation of evidence for informing
  policy at global, regional or national levels. Search Methods The EGM includes systematic
  reviews and impact evaluations assessing the effect of interventions for RTI reported
  in academic databases, organization websites, and grey literature sources. The studies
  were searched up to December 2019. Selection Criteria The interventions were divided
  into five broad categories: (a) human factors (e.g., enforcement or road user education),
  (b) road design, infrastructure and traffic control, (c) legal and institutional
  framework, (d) post-crash pre-hospital care, and (e) vehicle factors (except car
  design for occupant protection) and protective devices. Included studies reported
  two primary outcomes: fatal crashes and non-fatal injury crashes; and four intermediate
  outcomes: change in use of seat belts, change in use of helmets, change in speed,
  and change in alcohol/drug use. Studies were excluded if they did not report injury
  or fatality as one of the outcomes. Data Collection and Analysis The EGM is presented
  in the form of a matrix with two primary dimensions: interventions (rows) and outcomes
  (columns). Additional dimensions are country income groups, region, quality level
  for systematic reviews, type of study design used (e.g., case-control), type of
  road user studied (e.g., pedestrian, cyclists), age groups, and road type. The EGM
  is available online where the matrix of interventions and outcomes can be filtered
  by one or more dimensions. The webpage includes a bibliography of the selected studies
  and titles and abstracts available for preview. Quality appraisal for systematic
  reviews was conducted using a critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews, AMSTAR
  2. Main Results The EGM identified 1859 studies of which 322 were systematic reviews,
  7 were protocol studies and 1530 were impact evaluations. Some studies included
  more than one intervention, outcome, study method, or study region. The studies
  were distributed among intervention categories as: human factors (n = 771), road
  design, infrastructure and traffic control (n = 661), legal and institutional framework
  (n = 424), post-crash pre-hospital care (n = 118) and vehicle factors and protective
  devices (n = 111). Fatal crashes as outcomes were reported in 1414 records and non-fatal
  injury crashes in 1252 records. Among the four intermediate outcomes, speed was
  most commonly reported (n = 298) followed by alcohol (n = 206), use of seatbelts
  (n = 167), and use of helmets (n = 66). Ninety-six percent of the studies were reported
  from high-income countries (HIC), 4.5% from upper-middle-income countries, and only
  1.4% from lower-middle and low-income countries. There were 25 systematic reviews
  of high quality, 4 of moderate quality, and 293 of low quality. Authors' Conclusions
  The EGM shows that the distribution of available road safety evidence is skewed
  across the world. A vast majority of the literature is from HICs. In contrast, only
  a small fraction of the literature reports on the many LMICs that are fast expanding
  their road infrastructure, experiencing rapid changes in traffic patterns, and witnessing
  growth in road injuries. This bias in literature explains why many interventions
  that are of high importance in the context of LMICs remain poorly studied. Besides,
  many interventions that have been tested only in HICs may not work equally effectively
  in LMICs. Another important finding was that a large majority of systematic reviews
  are of low quality. The scarcity of evidence on many important interventions and
  lack of good quality evidence-synthesis have significant implications for future
  road safety research and practice in LMICs. The EGM presented here will help identify
  priority areas for researchers, while directing practitioners and policy makers
  towards proven interventions."
