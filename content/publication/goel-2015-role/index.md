abstract: Between late 1980s and 2014, the Greater Delhi region has witnessed an increase
  in vehicular fleet, four sets of emission standards, and changes in engine technology
  and fuel usage. This paper presents and evaluate these measures on on-road vehicle
  exhaust emissions under four counterfactual scenarios – (a) no penetration of 4-stroke
  (4S) 2-wheelers (2Ws) (b) no introduction of compressed natural gas (CNG) (c) no
  implementation of emission standards post 2000 and (d) no dual emission standards
  (supply of better fuel in the metropolitan areas and a grade lower for the rest).
  Introduction of 4S engines reduced VOC emissions by 90%, thus being the most effective
  compared to the three emission standards (BS-II, III, and IV) combined. Introducing
  CNG reduced 50% of PM2.5 and increased 20% of NOx emissions in 2014, mostly from
  buses and light duty vehicles. Implementation of emission standards affected all
  pollutants, with 60% reduction in VOCs and 20–30% reduction for the rest. Dual emission
  standards increased the PM2.5 emissions from heavy duty vehicles, as much as the
  reductions from passenger vehicles, thus negating the benefits of the latter. Under
  the proposed roadmap of emission standards and vehicular technology by the Auto
  Fuel Policy 2025 committee, PM2.5 emissions in 2030 will be halved, CO emissions
  will reach three times, and VOC and NOx emissions will at least stabilize, compared
  to 2014 estimates. If leapfrogged to BS-VI in 2017, there will be additional reduction
  in NOx and VOC emissions.
