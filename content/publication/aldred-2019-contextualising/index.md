abstract: Introduction The textquoterightSafety in Numberstextquoteright (SiN) phenomenon
  refers to a decline of injury risk per time or distance exposed as use of a mode
  increases. It has been demonstrated for cycling using cross-sectional data, but
  little evidence exists as to whether the effect applies longitudinally —that is,
  whether changes in cycling levels correlate with changes in per-cyclist injury risks.Methods
  This paper examines cross-sectional and longitudinal SiN effects in 202 local authorities
  in Britain, using commuting data from 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses plus police -recorded
  data on textquoterightkilled and seriously injuredtextquoteright (KSI) road traffic
  injuries. We modelled a log-linear relationship between number of injuries and number
  of cycle commuters. Second, we conducted longitudinal analysis to examine whether
  local authorities where commuter cycling increased became safer (and vice versa).Results
  The paper finds a cross-sectional SiN effect exists in the 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses.
  The longitudinal analysis also found a SiN effect, that is, places where cycling
  increased were more likely to become safer than places where it had declined. Finally,
  these longitudinal results are placed in the context of changes in pedestrian, cyclist
  and motorist safety. While between 1991 and 2001 all modes saw declines in KSI risk
  (37% for pedestrians, 36% for cyclists and 27% for motor vehicle users), between
  2001 and 2011 pedestrians and motorists saw even more substantial declines (41%
  and 49%), while risk for cyclists increased by 4%.Conclusion The SiN mechanism does
  seem to operate longitudinally as well as cross-sectionally. However, at a national
  level between 2001–11 it co-existed with an increase in cyclist injury risk both
  in absolute terms and in relation to other modes.
