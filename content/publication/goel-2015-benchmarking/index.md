abstract: In a mega-city like Delhi, vehicle exhaust emissions play a central role
  for urban air quality management, and measuring these on-road emissions in an environment
  with mixed fuels, mixed engine sizes, mixed technologies, and mixed usage patterns,
  is a challenging task, which means a better understanding of the vehicle and the
  passenger characteristics in the city is necessary. In this paper, we present a
  series of survey methods – vehicle owners' interviews at fuel stations, on-road
  observational studies, and use of data resources like vehicle registrations and
  pollution under check program, which can be utilized to benchmark parameters linked
  to an emissions inventory methodology (Activity–Share–Intensity–Factor – ASIF).
  We present estimates for fuel efficiency, age profiles, annual mileage, and number
  of in-use vehicles for cars, motorized two-wheelers (2Ws), three-wheeled scooter
  rickshaws (3Ws), and buses and modeled survival functions for cars and 2Ws using
  log-logistic distribution function. In addition, using GPS data logging, we evaluated
  speed distribution of buses, cars, 2Ws and 3Ws, which resulted in evaluating the
  modal idling times, all of which were utilized to develop a robust vehicle exhaust
  emissions inventory for Delhi – segregated by vehicle type, fuel type, and age group.
  The survey methods and analytical techniques are simple and fast to implement, which
  when replicated, can provide a useful data source to estimate on-road transport
  emissions in urban areas.
