abstract: This article discusses how the perennial focus on policies to mitigate vehicular
  sources of air pollution in Delhi ignores a significant contribution by sectors
  other than transport. This works to the detriment of framing sustainable transport
  policies for the city. Such policies should not be dictated by the sole objective
  to reduce vehicular air pollution; that should rather be seen as a co-benefit within
  the larger gains of accessible and safe transportation system.
