abstract: There is lack of literature on international comparison of gender differences
  in the use of active travel modes. We used population-representative travel surveys
  for 19 major cities across 13 countries and 6 continents, representing a mix of
  cites from low-and-middle income (nþinspace=þinspace8) and high-income countries
  (nþinspace=þinspace11). In all the cities, females are more likely than males to
  walk and, in most cities, more likely to use public transport. This relationship
  reverses in cycling, with females often less likely users than males. In high cycling
  cities, both genders are equally likely to cycle. Active travel to access public
  transport contributes 30--50% of total active travel time. The gender differences
  in active travel metrics are age dependent. Among children (<þinspace16~years),
  these metrics are often equal for girls and boys, while gender disparity increases
  with age. On average, active travel enables one in every four people in the population
  to achieve at least 30~min of physical activity in a day, though there is large
  variation across the cities. In general, females are more likely to achieve this
  level than males. The results highlight the importance of a gendered approach towards
  active transport policies. Such an approach necessitates reducing road traffic danger
  and male violence, as well as overcoming social norms that restrict women from cycling.
