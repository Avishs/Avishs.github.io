abstract: 'During periods from January 1 to January 15 and April 15 to April 30, 2016,
  the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, India, implemented an
  odd–even vehicle rule. Under this rule, between 08:00 and 20:00, only cars with
  even-numbered plates were allowed to operate on even-numbered dates of the calendar
  and only cars with odd-numbered plates on odd-numbered dates. In light of the varying
  experiences of vehicle restriction practices from around the world, this study evaluated
  the effects of both phases of the odd–even policy on transport patterns and vehicle
  use in Delhi. Observational surveys were carried out at four locations in Delhi
  to observe traffic flow and vehicle occupancy data. Speed data were extracted for
  38 origin–destination pairs during the January phase and for 66 pairs for the April
  phase, with a sample of roads from all over Delhi and with Google Maps API (application
  programming interface) software. During the experimental periods, car flow rates
  on roads were reduced by less than 20%, but rates increased for motorized two-wheelers,
  buses, and autorickshaws. There was an insignificant rise in car occupancy rates:
  most car owners did not opt for carsharing. No improvements in levels of particulate
  matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm (PM2.5) were detected. These experiments
  show that the odd–even rule was not effective in reducing measureable PM2.5 pollution
  in Delhi.'
