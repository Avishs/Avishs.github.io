 abstract = {The presence of land sea breezes is advantageous to Chennai and Vishakhapatnam. With most industrial and power plant emissions dispersed to the sea, their overall impact on the urban air quality is lessened. However, the same is not true for the diffused emissions, such as the vehicle exhaust, domestic cooking, open waste burning, and road dust, which are steadily increasing. The annual averages for 2012 in Chennai are 121.5þinspace\textpmþinspace45.5, 12.1þinspace\textpmþinspace3.5, and 20.8þinspace\textpmþinspace7.0 and in Vishakhapatnam are 70.4þinspace\textpmþinspace29.7, 18.9þinspace\textpmþinspace14.4, and 15.6þinspace\textpmþinspace6.3, for PM10, SO2, and NO2 respectively. All the concentrations are reported in micrograms per cubic millimeter. In this paper, we present sector-specific emissions inventory for particulate and gaseous pollutants, which is spatially disaggregated at 0.01° resolution, suitable for atmospheric dispersion modeling. For the urban airshed, the ambient particulate concentrations were modeled using the ATMoS dispersion model, which when overlaid on gridded population, resulted in estimated 4,850 and 1,250 premature deaths and 390,000 and 110,000 asthma attacks in year 2012, for the Greater Chennai and the Greater Vishakhapatnam regions, respectively. The total emissions are also projected to 2030. Under the current growth rates and policy assumptions, the pollution levels are likely to further increase, if the expected changes in the industrial energy efficiency, environmental regulations in the power plants, and fuel standards for the vehicles are not introduced as planned.},
