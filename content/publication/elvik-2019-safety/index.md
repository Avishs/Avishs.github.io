abstract: Safety-in-numbers denotes the tendency for the number of accidents to increase
  less than in proportion to traffic volume. This paper updates a meta-analysis of
  estimates of safety-in-numbers published in 2017 (Elvik and Bjørnskau, Safety Science,
  92, 274–282). Nearly all studies find safety-in-numbers, but the numerical estimates
  vary considerably. As virtually all studies are cross-sectional, it is not possible
  to determine if safety-in-numbers represents a causal relationship. Meta-regression
  analysis was performed to identify factors which may explain the large heterogeneity
  of estimates of safety-in-numbers. It was found that safety-in-numbers tends to
  be stronger for pedestrians than for cyclists, and stronger at the macro-level (e.g.
  citywide) than at the micro-level (e.g. in junctions). Recent studies find a stronger
  tendency towards safety-in-numbers than older studies.
