abstract: 'There is a lack of data on physical activity (PA), active travel, and the
  comparison of measurement instruments in low-resource settings. The objective of
  this paper is to describe PA behaviour and the agreement of walking estimates from
  the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and the travel diary in a low-resource
  setting. We used a cross-sectional survey design to capture data from the residents
  of Accra (Ghana) between May 2020 and March 2021. Of the 863 participants aged 15+
  years, 65% were females, and 86% reported PA. The median weekly PA was 18 (interquartile
  range: 5–75) metabolic equivalent of task hours, with 50% of females and 37% of
  males achieving low PA levels. In the GPAQ, 80% of participants reported weekly
  walking; the mean number of days walked was 3.8 (standard deviation (SD): 2.5);
  hence, 54% of participants reported walking on any day, and the mean daily walking
  duration was 51 (SD: 82) minutes. In the diary, 56% of participants reported walking
  for over 24 h, with a mean walking duration of 31 (SD: 65) minutes. The correlation
  of walking duration between instruments was weak (rho: 0.31; 95% Confidence Interval:
  0.25–0.37); the mean bias was 20 min, with GPAQ estimates being 0.1 to 9 times higher
  than diary estimates. We concluded that low PA is prevalent in Accra, and while
  the travel diary and GPAQ estimate similar walking prevalence, their walking duration
  agreement is poor. We recommend accompanying PA questionnaires with objective measures
  for calibration.'
