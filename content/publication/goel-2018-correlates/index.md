abstract: Pedestrians, cyclists, and users of motorised two-wheelers account for more
  than 85% of all the road fatality victims in Delhi. The three categories are often
  referred to as vulnerable road users (VRUs). Using Bayesian hierarchical approach
  with a Poisson-lognormal regression model, we present spatial analysis of road fatalities
  of VRUs with wards as areal units. The model accounts for spatially uncorrelated
  as well as correlated error. The explanatory variables include demographic factors,
  traffic characteristics, as well as built environment features. We found that fatality
  risk has a negative association with socio-economic status (literacy rate), population
  density, and number of roundabouts, and has a positive association with percentage
  of population as workers, number of bus stops, number of flyovers (grade separators),
  and vehicle kilometers travelled. The negative effect of roundabouts, though statistically
  insignificant, is in accordance with their speed calming effects for which they
  have been used to replace signalised junctions in various parts of the world. Fatality
  risk is 80% higher at the density of 50 persons per hectare (pph) than at overall
  city-wide density of 250 pph. The presence of a flyover increases the relative risk
  by 15% compared to no flyover. Future studies should investigate the causal mechanism
  through which denser neighborhoods become safer. Given the risk posed by flyovers,
  their use as congestion mitigation measure should be discontinued within urban areas.
