 abstract = {During the last 30 years, many cities and countries have promoted cycling to increase livability and the sustainability of their transport systems. This chapter provides an overview of bicycling internationally, comparing differences in cycling levels, trends, distance, duration, speed, as well as gender and age of cyclists across countries and cities. The first part of the chapter focuses on traditional non-motorized bicycles. This is followed by a section summarizing the current spread and usage of electric bicycles (e-bikes). The goal of the chapter is to provide a global overview of cycling levels in countries and cities and to identify similarities and differences in trip making, trip distance as well as age and gender of cyclists internationally.},
