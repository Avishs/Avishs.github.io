abstract: For a 40-year horizon (1990–2030), on-road vehicle exhaust emissions were
  evaluated, retrospectively and prospectively, for the largest urban agglomeration
  in India – the Greater Delhi region with a combined population of 22 million in
  2011 (Delhi along with Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Faridabad and Gurgaon).
  Emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and volatile organic
  compounds (VOCs) reached their peak during late 1990s through early 2000s after
  which they reduced significantly through year 2012. On the other hand, nitrogen
  oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide show an increasing trend. The most reduction in
  emissions between 1998 and 2012 occurred as a result of implementation of four sets
  of vehicular emission standards, removal of lead, reduction of sulfur content, mandatory
  retirement of older commercial vehicles, and conversion of diesel and petrol run
  public transport vehicles to compressed natural gas. In addition, changes in the
  vehicular technology have also contributed to controlling emissions especially in
  case of auto-rickshaws and motorized two-wheelers, which changed from two-stroke
  to four-stroke. The rising trend of NOx along with the presence of VOCs indicates
  increasing tendency to form ground-level ozone and as a result, smog in the region.
  We predict that the current regime of vehicle technology, fuel standards, and high
  growth rate of private vehicles, is likely to nullify all the past emission reductions
  by the end of 2020s.
