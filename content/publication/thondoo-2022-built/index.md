abstract: Features and attributes of the built environment (BE) impact positively
  and negatively on health, especially in cities facing unprecedented urban population
  growth and mass motorization. A common approach to assess the health impacts of
  built environment is health impact assessment (HIA), but it is rarely used in low-
  and middle-income countries (LMICs) where urbanization rates are fastest. This article
  reviews selected HIA case studies from LMICs and reports the methods and tools used
  to support further implementation of quantitative HIAs in cities of LMICs.
