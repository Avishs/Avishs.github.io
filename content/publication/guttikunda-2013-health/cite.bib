 abstract = {In Delhi and its satellite cities, vehicle exhaust, industries, waste burning, and construction activities account for the bulk of the particulate (PM) pollution, which between 2008 and 2011, averaged 123±87\ensuremathμg/m3 for PM2.5 and 208±137\ensuremathμg/m3 for PM10, both exceeding the national annual ambient standards of 40\ensuremathμg/m3 and 60\ensuremathμg/m3, respectively.Amulti-sectoral emissions inventory for 2010 was modeled using the ATMoS dispersion model and local meteorology to estimate health impacts in terms of premature mortality and morbidity effects. For the observed PM levels in the city, the health impacts analysis estimates 7,350–16,200 premature deaths and 6.0 million asthma attacks per year. For six residential and industrial zones, we also modeled the sector contributions to ambient PM2.5 ranging 16–34% for vehicle exhaust, 20–27% for diffused sources, 14–21% for industries, 3–16% diesel generator sets, and 4–17% brick kilns. Finally, we present some thoughts on technological, institutional, and behavioral interventions that might help the Government of Delhi to develop an action plan encompassing multiple sources and include interventions to reduce health impacts in the future years.},
