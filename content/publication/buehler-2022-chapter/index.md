abstract: During the last 30 years, many cities and countries have promoted cycling
  to increase livability and the sustainability of their transport systems. This chapter
  provides an overview of bicycling internationally, comparing differences in cycling
  levels, trends, distance, duration, speed, as well as gender and age of cyclists
  across countries and cities. The first part of the chapter focuses on traditional
  non-motorized bicycles. This is followed by a section summarizing the current spread
  and usage of electric bicycles (e-bikes). The goal of the chapter is to provide
  a global overview of cycling levels in countries and cities and to identify similarities
  and differences in trip making, trip distance as well as age and gender of cyclists
  internationally.
