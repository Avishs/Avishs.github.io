  abstract     = {In this work an integrated approach has been proposed to identify and schedule a rail transit corridor in a city which has a potential demand for a new rail based mass transit system besides the street transit system and existing rail-based system (if any). The motivation for the present study comes from the present Indian context where, because of recent initiatives of Central Urban Development Ministry, many Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and transit agencies need to master plan new rail based systems in an optimum way and at the same time attempting to integrate them with other existing public transport (PT) modes. While aligning the new rail transit system, the primary focus of the integrated approach is to optimize the origin–destination (O–D) travel time of the user and at the same time attempting to minimize the operators' cost. The proposed rail corridor identification model consists of three stages: public transport demand forecasting, creation of corridor link set, and optimization of rail corridor using Geographical Information System (GIS). The objective function for train scheduling model is fixed as minimization of sum of operating cost of trains (operator cost) and total waiting time cost of passengers boarding the train (user costs) subject to load factor and waiting time constraints. The dwell time of train at stations, which is usually considered constant, has been taken as a variable which depends on the actual number of passengers boarding and alighting the train. The model is applied on Thane municipal corporation (TMC) area, a major urban center of the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR), India. The maximum peak hour ridership obtained on the identified corridor was found to be ideal for recommending light-rail transit system (LRT). The successful application of the model shows the capability of proposed model for a typical Indian city, which has potential demand for a new rail system.}

  abstract     = {This research examined the major changes in a corridor due to high occupancy/toll (HOT) lane implementation. This was accomplished by comparing the impacts of HOT lanes on three pairs of HOT lanes with similar design and operational characteristics. These pairwise comparisons of similar HOT lanes reduced the impact of exogenous factors and removed the issue of comparing HOT lanes that were so dissimilar it would be impossible to isolate the reasons for difference in results from the lanes. With strict registration requirements for free high occupancy vehicle (HOV) 3+ travel on the I-95 Express Lanes (ELs) in Miami there were indications that some carpoolers switched to lower occupancy modes. Tolled access for HOV2s on I-95 and the SR-91 ELs near Los Angeles resulted in lower usage of those ELs by the HOV2s as compared to most HOV lanes where HOV2 access is free. On the SR167 (Seattle) and I-25 (Denver) HOT lanes, exogenous factors like the price of gas and the economic recession seemed to be the primary influence on the usage of those HOT lanes. In both cases, carpool usage increased along with the price of gas. On I-25, the increasing unemployment rate coincided with a decrease in toll paying travelers. On SR 167 there were also indications of mode shifts among the transit, carpool and toll paying SOVs due to the fluctuating price of gas.}

For the observed PM levels in the city, the health impacts analysis estimates 7,350–16,200 premature deaths and 6.0 million asthma attacks per year. For six residential and industrial zones, we also modeled the sector contributions to ambient PM2.5 ranging 16–34\% for vehicle exhaust, 20–27\% for diffused sources, 14–21\% for industries, 3–16\% diesel generator sets, and 4–17\% brick kilns. Finally, we present some thoughts on technological, institutional, and behavioral interventions that might help the Government of Delhi to develop an action plan encompassing multiple sources and include interventions to reduce health impacts in the future years.}

Emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) reached their peak during late 1990s through early 2000s after which they reduced significantly through year 2012. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide show an increasing trend. The most reduction in emissions between 1998 and 2012 occurred as a result of implementation of four sets of vehicular emission standards, removal of lead, reduction of sulfur content, mandatory retirement of older commercial vehicles, and conversion of diesel and petrol run public transport vehicles to compressed natural gas. In addition, changes in the vehicular technology have also contributed to controlling emissions especially in case of auto-rickshaws and motorized two-wheelers, which changed from two-stroke to four-stroke. The rising trend of NOx along with the presence of VOCs indicates increasing tendency to form ground-level ozone and as a result, smog in the region. We predict that the current regime of vehicle technology, fuel standards, and high growth rate of private vehicles, is likely to nullify all the past emission reductions by the end of 2020s.}

For this setting, we present on-road exposure of PM2.5 concentrations for 11 transport microenvironments along a fixed 8.3-km arterial route, during morning rush hour. The data collection was carried out using a portable TSI DustTrak DRX 8433 aerosol monitor, between January and May (2014). The monthly-average measured ambient concentrations varied from 130~\ensuremath{\mu}g/m3 to 250~\ensuremath{\mu}g/m3. The on-road PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the ambient measurements by an average of 40\% for walking, 10\% for cycle, 30\% for motorised two wheeler (2W), 30\% for open-windowed (OW) car, 30\% for auto rickshaw, 20\% for air-conditioned as well as for OW bus, 20\% for bus stop, and 30\% for underground metro station. On the other hand, concentrations were lower by 50\% inside air-conditioned (AC) car and 20\% inside the metro rail carriage. We find that the percent exceedance for open modes (cycle, auto rickshaw, 2W, OW car, and OW bus) reduces non-linearly with increasing ambient concentration. The reduction is steeper at concentrations lower than 150~\ensuremath{\mu}g/m3 than at higher concentrations. After accounting for air inhalation rate and speed of travel, PM2.5 mass uptake per kilometer during cycling is 9 times of AC car, the mode with the lowest exposure. At current level of concentrations, an hour of cycling in Delhi during morning rush-hour period results in PM2.5 dose which is 40\% higher than an entire-day dose in cities like Tokyo, London, and New York, where ambient concentrations range from 10 to 20~\ensuremath{\mu}g/m3.}

In this paper, we present a series of survey methods – vehicle owners' interviews at fuel stations, on-road observational studies, and use of data resources like vehicle registrations and pollution under check program, which can be utilized to benchmark parameters linked to an emissions inventory methodology (Activity–Share–Intensity–Factor – ASIF). We present estimates for fuel efficiency, age profiles, annual mileage, and number of in-use vehicles for cars, motorized two-wheelers (2Ws), three-wheeled scooter rickshaws (3Ws), and buses and modeled survival functions for cars and 2Ws using log-logistic distribution function. In addition, using GPS data logging, we evaluated speed distribution of buses, cars, 2Ws and 3Ws, which resulted in evaluating the modal idling times, all of which were utilized to develop a robust vehicle exhaust emissions inventory for Delhi – segregated by vehicle type, fuel type, and age group. The survey methods and analytical techniques are simple and fast to implement, which when replicated, can provide a useful data source to estimate on-road transport emissions in urban areas.}

All the concentrations are reported in micrograms per cubic millimeter. In this paper, we present sector-specific emissions inventory for particulate and gaseous pollutants, which is spatially disaggregated at 0.01{\textdegree} resolution, suitable for atmospheric dispersion modeling. For the urban airshed, the ambient particulate concentrations were modeled using the ATMoS dispersion model, which when overlaid on gridded population, resulted in estimated 4,850 and 1,250 premature deaths and 390,000 and 110,000 asthma attacks in year 2012, for the Greater Chennai and the Greater Vishakhapatnam regions, respectively. The total emissions are also projected to 2030. Under the current growth rates and policy assumptions, the pollution levels are likely to further increase, if the expected changes in the industrial energy efficiency, environmental regulations in the power plants, and fuel standards for the vehicles are not introduced as planned.}

Introduction of 4S engines reduced VOC emissions by 90\%, thus being the most effective compared to the three emission standards (BS-II, III, and IV) combined. Introducing CNG reduced 50\% of PM2.5 and increased 20\% of NOx emissions in 2014, mostly from buses and light duty vehicles. Implementation of emission standards affected all pollutants, with 60\% reduction in VOCs and 20–30\% reduction for the rest. Dual emission standards increased the PM2.5 emissions from heavy duty vehicles, as much as the reductions from passenger vehicles, thus negating the benefits of the latter. Under the proposed roadmap of emission standards and vehicular technology by the Auto Fuel Policy 2025 committee, PM2.5 emissions in 2030 will be halved, CO emissions will reach three times, and VOC and NOx emissions will at least stabilize, compared to 2014 estimates. If leapfrogged to BS-VI in 2017, there will be additional reduction in NOx and VOC emissions.}

For this study, we conducted an on-board survey of metro commuters (n=1112) in 2011. Survey respondents reported use of seven different modes to access metro stations, with 55\% using non-motorized modes. The alternative modes reported by the respondents indicate that, in the absence of metro, a majority of commuters will use bus, and up to 40\% will use private motorized modes. Up to 18\% of the respondents may not have made the trips if metro was not available, indicating a significant proportion of induced trips. We used multinomial logistic regression models to understand the factors associated with the choice of access–egress modes, as well as alternative mode, for the current trip. Trip length, vehicle ownership, location of metro station (classified as administrative units within Delhi, and neighbouring cities), and population density around metro station have statistically significant associations with the choice of access/egress modes. Alternative modes of metro trips are found to be dependent on trip length and vehicle ownership. We found that up to 88\% of metro trips have an interconnectivity ratio with the range of 0.2 to 0.5, with 0.4 as the mean, corroborating the results of [13] for a European setting. The results indicate that this ratio may be universally applicable, thus making it a robust parameter to assess, or forecast, ridership of public transportation systems.}

The private vehicular fleet in India is the youngest, its fuel efficiency one of the highest, and annual kilometers travelled is the lowest, compared to many high-income countries, such as the USA and those in European Union.

Elements such as Al, Si and Fe were found to be in predominantly in the coarse range while Cu, Zn, Pb and Sb were found to be in the fine size range. Two modes dominate the size distribution. One is coarse (ca. 3~\ensuremath{\mu}m) and contains mainly crustal elements and hence arises from sources such as soil, road dust, construction dust and possible coal fly ash. The other, more intense mode is fine (ca. 0.6~\ensuremath{\mu}m) and appears to comprise sulphate and anthropogenic trace metals which have entered the droplet mode through hygroscopic particle growth in the very high humidity conditions of the Delhi winter. A third, less intensive mode ca. at 0.2~\ensuremath{\mu}m probably arises from relatively fresh anthropogenic emissions which have not grown into the droplet mode.}

  abstract     = {During periods from January 1 to January 15 and April 15 to April 30, 2016, the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, India, implemented an odd–even vehicle rule. Under this rule, between 08:00 and 20:00, only cars with even-numbered plates were allowed to operate on even-numbered dates of the calendar and only cars with odd-numbered plates on odd-numbered dates. In light of the varying experiences of vehicle restriction practices from around the world, this study evaluated the effects of both phases of the odd–even policy on transport patterns and vehicle use in Delhi. Observational surveys were carried out at four locations in Delhi to observe traffic flow and vehicle occupancy data. Speed data were extracted for 38 origin–destination pairs during the January phase and for 66 pairs for the April phase, with a sample of roads from all over Delhi and with Google Maps API (application programming interface) software. During the experimental periods, car flow rates on roads were reduced by less than 20\%, but rates increased for motorized two-wheelers, buses, and autorickshaws. There was an insignificant rise in car occupancy rates: most car owners did not opt for carsharing. No improvements in levels of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \mathrm{\mu}m (PM2.5) were detected. These experiments show that the odd–even rule was not effective in reducing measureable PM2.5 pollution in Delhi.}

  abstract     = {Background Urban land transport has positive (physical activity) and negative (road traffic injuries and air pollutants) side effects. Studies in high income cities have found substantial population health benefits from mode shift to active travel, with physical activity dominating the impact. However, our earlier work in Brazil, India, and Malaysia identifies a more varied picture, with a larger burden and trickier trade-offs. To investigate risks and benefits in low and medium income countries (LMICs), we will conduct in year 2017-19 international project, TIGTHAT, which will develop methods to estimate these trade-offs. Methods In this project we lay the basis for a globally applicable stochastic synthesis engine with a user friendly interface, to support evidence based decision making on transport and health. A key challenge is data comparability and quality. Our international, multidisciplinary team will assess what data is available and develop approaches for mapping (calibrating) available to desired data, while representing propagated uncertainty. The main objectives of TIGTHAT are: Health Impact modelling (physical activity, air pollution, and road traffic injuries) of scenarios for two new cities in India (Bengaluru and Visakhapatnam) and developing and reanalysing for two already analysed cities (Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Delhi, India). The objective is both to generate results about the size of impacts, but more importantly to understand how choice of data and uncertainty affects the results. Test the feasibility of Google Street View to estimate traffic mode share in multiple cities, and to develop an ecological model to predict population distributions of travel time mode share and total physical activity. Appraise urban traffic injury data in a range of settings globally, identify patterns, develop generalizable rules for combining data, and validate by testing them in selected cities Develop and test a generalizable approach to estimate changes in transport related air pollution (fine particulate matter, PM2.5) Identify, evaluate, and compare personal travel survey data for multiple settings and how estimates for travel physical activity could differ due to diverse survey methods. Results This project lays the foundation for an analytic modelling framework to estimate multiple outcomes with respect to a major determinant of population health. In this presentation we will describe the work plan and position it within the wider scientific and policy challenge. Preliminary results for Delhi and Sao Paulo will be presented. Conclusions We will organise a group exercise to develop a shared understanding of data issues relating to modelling impacts in LMICs.}

  abstract     = {Background Motorised transport contributes to health burden resulting from inactive lifestyles, air pollution (AP), and road traffic injuries (RTI). The burden is the greatest in rapidly motorising, low- and middle-income countries such as India. Cities in India are generally more polluted, travel is conducted through a diverse range of travel modes, and number of motor vehicles is growing rapidly in the absence of sufficient infrastructure for walking and cycling. The magnitude of health burden due to the three risk factors (AP, RTI and physical activity (PA)) and their determinants have not been quantified in India at a city level. Methods We present a case study of Delhi. We estimated travel patterns from household travel survey, developed emission forecast model for transport and modelled fine particulate AP, measured on-road exposure to pollution, and analysed RTI database. We used comparative risk assessment approach to estimate the baseline health burden attributed to the three risk factors. Results Pollution exposure and injury risk during active travel are an order of magnitude higher than in high-income settings. We estimated that 9\% of all-cause mortality for population older than 15 years is attributed to transport-related AP or RTI. Up to 13\% of baseline death burden has been prevented due to current levels of travel-related PA. In the presence of multitude of pollution sources, the share of passenger travel (motorised two-wheelers, cars, buses and auto rickshaws) to overall pollution remains modest (10\%).There are significant sex-specific differences in health burden. These result from lower share of females in overall travel and higher baseline health burden among males. Exposure estimates also indicate significant socio-economic inequalities. Conclusions High levels of air pollution exposure and injury risk during active travel compared to cars need to be reduced to retain the current mode shares. Continuing absence of physical activity from public discourse on transport in India needs to be addressed. AP mitigation policies with a focus only on passenger transport will be insufficient to have any significant impact. Sustained reduction in the current levels of AP can only be achieved through a multi-sector strategy.}

Studies have reported using this data to audit road infrastructure and other built environment features. Here we explore a novel application, using Google Street View (GSV) to predict travel patterns at the city level.   Methods We sampled 34 cities in Great Britain. In each city, we accessed 2000 GSV images from 1000 random locations. We selected archived images from time periods overlapping with the 2011 Census and the 2011–2013 Active People Survey (APS). We manually annotated the images into seven categories of road users. We developed regression models with the counts of images of road users as predictors. The outcomes included Census-reported commute shares of four modes (combined walking plus public transport, cycling, motorcycle, and car), as well as APS-reported past-month participation in walking and cycling.   Results We found high correlations between GSV counts of cyclists (`GSV-cyclists') and cycle commute mode share (r = 0.92)/past-month cycling (r = 0.90). Likewise, GSV-pedestrians was moderately correlated with past-month walking for transport (r = 0.46), GSV-motorcycles was moderately correlated with commute share of motorcycles (r = 0.44), and GSV-buses was highly correlated with commute share of walking plus public transport (r = 0.81). GSV-car was not correlated with car commute mode share (r = –0.12). However, in multivariable regression models, all outcomes were predicted well, except past-month walking. The prediction performance was measured using cross-validation analyses. GSV-buses and GSV-cyclists are the strongest predictors for most outcomes.   Conclusions GSV images are a promising new big data source to predict urban mobility patterns. Predictive power was the greatest for those modes that varied the most (cycle and bus). With its ability to identify mode of travel and capture street activity often excluded in routinely carried out surveys, GSV has the potential to be complementary to new and traditional data. With half the world's population covered by street imagery, and with up to 10 years historical data available in GSV, further testing across multiple settings is warranted both for cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments.}

The three categories are often referred to as vulnerable road users (VRUs). Using Bayesian hierarchical approach with a Poisson-lognormal regression model, we present spatial analysis of road fatalities of VRUs with wards as areal units. The model accounts for spatially uncorrelated as well as correlated error. The explanatory variables include demographic factors, traffic characteristics, as well as built environment features. We found that fatality risk has a negative association with socio-economic status (literacy rate), population density, and number of roundabouts, and has a positive association with percentage of population as workers, number of bus stops, number of flyovers (grade separators), and vehicle kilometers travelled. The negative effect of roundabouts, though statistically insignificant, is in accordance with their speed calming effects for which they have been used to replace signalised junctions in various parts of the world. Fatality risk is 80\% higher at the density of 50 persons per hectare (pph) than at overall city-wide density of 250 pph. The presence of a flyover increases the relative risk by 15\% compared to no flyover. Future studies should investigate the causal mechanism through which denser neighborhoods become safer. Given the risk posed by flyovers, their use as congestion mitigation measure should be discontinued within urban areas.}

However, epidemiological studies of traffic crashes in India have been limited in their approach to account for the exposure of these road users. In 2011, for the first time, census in India reported travel distance and mode of travel for workers. A Poisson-lognormal mixture regression model is developed at the state level to explore the relationship of road deaths of all the road users with commute travel distance by different on-road modes. The model controlled for diesel consumption (proxy for freight traffic), length of national highways, proportion of population in urban areas, and built-up population density. The results show that walking, cycling and, interestingly, IPT are associated with lower risk of road deaths, while 2W, car and bus are associated with higher risk. Promotion of IPT has twofold benefits of increasing safety as well as providing a sustainable mode of transport. The mode shift scenarios show that, for similar mode shift across the states, the resulting trends in road deaths are highly dependent on the baseline mode shares. The most worrying trend is the steep growth of death burden resulting from mode shift of walking and cycling to 2W. While the paper illustrates a limited set of mode shift scenarios involving two modes at a time, the model can be applied to assess safety impacts resulting from a more complex set of scenarios.}

Nearly all studies find safety-in-numbers, but the numerical estimates vary considerably. As virtually all studies are cross-sectional, it is not possible to determine if safety-in-numbers represents a causal relationship. Meta-regression analysis was performed to identify factors which may explain the large heterogeneity of estimates of safety-in-numbers. It was found that safety-in-numbers tends to be stronger for pedestrians than for cyclists, and stronger at the macro-level (e.g. citywide) than at the micro-level (e.g. in junctions). Recent studies find a stronger tendency towards safety-in-numbers than older studies.}

It has been demonstrated for cycling using cross-sectional data, but little evidence exists as to whether the effect applies longitudinally {\textemdash}that is, whether changes in cycling levels correlate with changes in per-cyclist injury risks.Methods This paper examines cross-sectional and longitudinal SiN effects in 202 local authorities in Britain, using commuting data from 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses plus police -recorded data on {\textquoteright}killed and seriously injured{\textquoteright} (KSI) road traffic injuries. We modelled a log-linear relationship between number of injuries and number of cycle commuters. Second, we conducted longitudinal analysis to examine whether local authorities where commuter cycling increased became safer (and vice versa).Results The paper finds a cross-sectional SiN effect exists in the 1991, 2001 and 2011 censuses. The longitudinal analysis also found a SiN effect, that is, places where cycling increased were more likely to become safer than places where it had declined. Finally, these longitudinal results are placed in the context of changes in pedestrian, cyclist and motorist safety. While between 1991 and 2001 all modes saw declines in KSI risk (37\% for pedestrians, 36\% for cyclists and 27\% for motor vehicle users), between 2001 and 2011 pedestrians and motorists saw even more substantial declines (41\% and 49\%), while risk for cyclists increased by 4\%.Conclusion The SiN mechanism does seem to operate longitudinally as well as cross-sectionally. However, at a national level between 2001{\textendash}11 it co-existed with an increase in cyclist injury risk both in absolute terms and in relation to other modes.},

Much of the evidence for this comes from research in low-density, high-income settings. The 2011 Census of India reported mode of travel to work and distance for the first time. We have used these data to investigate the effect of urban density on commute travel patterns at city-level for Indian cities. In addition, we investigated the relationship between travel behaviour and other city-level variables. Using regression, we found almost no independent effect of density on the mode share of walk, cycle, motorised two-wheelers, cars and public transport, after controlling for population and income levels for the cities. Further, it appears that once density levels are greater than ~80 persons per hectare (pph), other factors become more important in determining travel patterns in cities. This evidence has significant implications for urban planning and transport policy in Indian cities and for many other low- and middle-income cities where average density tends to be higher than ~80~pph. For these cities, growth in the use of sustainable transport may not depend on further densification of already dense cities, but on details of how neighbourhoods and streets are designed.}

Objective To quantify the health impacts of changes in travel patterns in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana. Methods We estimated changes to population exposures to physical activity, air pollution, and road traffic fatality risk and consequent health burden (deaths and years of life lost prematurely – YLL) in response to changes in transportation patterns. Five scenarios were defined in collaboration with international and local partners and stakeholders to reflect potential local policy actions. Results Swapping bus and walking trips for car trips can lead to more than 400 extra deaths and 20,500 YLL per year than travel patterns observed in 2009. If part of the rise in motorisation is from motorcycles, we estimated an additional nearly 370 deaths and over 18,500 YLL per year. Mitigating the rise in motorisation by swapping long trips by car or taxi to bus trips is the most beneficial for health, averting more than 600 premature deaths and over 31,500 YLL per year. Without significant improvements in road safety, reduction of short motorised trips in favour of cycling and walking had no significant net health benefits as non-communicable diseases deaths and YLL benefits were offset by increases in road traffic deaths. In all scenarios, road traffic fatalities were the largest contributor to changes in deaths and YLL. Conclusions Rising motorisation, particularly from motorcycles, can cause significant increase in health burden in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area. Mitigating rising motorisation by improving public transport would benefit population health. Tackling road injury risk to ensure safe walking and cycling is a top priority. In the short term, this will save lives from injury. Longer term it will help halt the likely fall in physical activity.}

  abstract     = {Enforcement of traffic rules and regulations forms an important component of strategies to reduce deaths and injuries due to road traffic crashes. As with many other issues concerning road safety policy, it is not always clear whether common sense approaches in police enforcement actually reduce injuries and fatalities on the road. It is therefore important to assess whether a given enforcement measure, though seemingly beneficial in its intent, actually results in any reduction of delinquent behaviour of drivers and number of crashes. In this article, we assess the evidence base of effectiveness of on-road enforcement measures by conducting a review of systematic reviews on this topic. In this review, we focused only on the objective police programmes or strategies and excluded the reviews which assessed the effectiveness of a traffic enforcement law. We answer the following questions in this review: (a) what is the theoretical basis of different enforcement measures? (b) What are the different road safety enforcement measures for which evidence is available in systematic reviews and how current is this evidence? (c) What are the different limitations or drawbacks of different studies as reported by the systematic reviews and what are their implications on results? (d) What are the different factors which limit the generalisations of available evidence across different settings or across different types of modes? Our review suggests that: (i) legislation and enforcement are effective when violations are visible and easy to detect. (ii) Strict punishment not as effective as subjective perception of being caught violating a law. (iii) There is an absence of studies that could provide guidelines on police enforcement for low and middle-income countries on the following issues: (a) influence of road and infrastructure design on traffic violations and the difficulties of enforcement when designs are not adequate for the kind and volume of road users present; (b) critical/minimum levels of enforcement necessary for different traffic violations; (c) enforcement methods that would be cost effective in situations with high proportion of motorcycles and other vulnerable road users.}

The objective of this paper is to describe PA behaviour and the agreement of walking estimates from the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and the travel diary in a low-resource setting. We used a cross-sectional survey design to capture data from the residents of Accra (Ghana) between May 2020 and March 2021. Of the 863 participants aged 15+ years, 65\% were females, and 86\% reported PA. The median weekly PA was 18 (interquartile range: 5–75) metabolic equivalent of task hours, with 50\% of females and 37\% of males achieving low PA levels. In the GPAQ, 80\% of participants reported weekly walking; the mean number of days walked was 3.8 (standard deviation (SD): 2.5); hence, 54\% of participants reported walking on any day, and the mean daily walking duration was 51 (SD: 82) minutes. In the diary, 56\% of participants reported walking for over 24 h, with a mean walking duration of 31 (SD: 65) minutes. The correlation of walking duration between instruments was weak (rho: 0.31; 95\% Confidence Interval: 0.25–0.37); the mean bias was 20 min, with GPAQ estimates being 0.1 to 9 times higher than diary estimates. We concluded that low PA is prevalent in Accra, and while the travel diary and GPAQ estimate similar walking prevalence, their walking duration agreement is poor. We recommend accompanying PA questionnaires with objective measures for calibration.}

  abstract     = {Traffic is one of the major contributors to PM2.5 in cities worldwide. Quantifying the role of traffic is an important step towards understanding the impact of transport policies on the possibilities to achieve cleaner air and accompanying health benefits. With the aim of estimating potential health benefits of eliminating traffic emissions, we carried out a meta-analysis using the World Health Organisation (WHO) database of source apportionment studies of PM2.5 concentrations. Specifically, we used a Bayesian meta-regression approach, modelling both overall and traffic-related (tailpipe and non-tailpipe) concentrations simultaneously. We obtained the distributions of expected PM2.5 concentrations (posterior densities) of different types for 117 cities worldwide. Using the non-linear Integrated Exposure Response (IER) function of PM2.5, we estimated percent reduction in different disease endpoints for a scenario with complete removal of traffic emissions. We found that eliminating traffic emissions results in achieving the WHO-recommended concentration of PM2.5 only for a handful of cities that already have low concentrations of pollution. The percentage reduction in premature mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases increases up to a point (30–40 ug/m3), and above this concentration, it flattens off. For diabetes-related mortality, the percentage reduction in mortality decreases with increasing concentrations--a trend that is opposite to other outcomes. For cities with high concentrations of pollution, the results highlight the need for multi-sectoral strategies to reduce pollution. The IER functions of PM2.5 result in diminishing returns of health benefits at high concentrations, and in case of diabetes, there are even negative returns. The results show the significant effect of the shape of IER functions on health benefits. Overall, despite the diminishing results, a significant burden of deaths can be prevented by policies that aim to reduce traffic emissions even at high concentrations of pollution.}

In all the cities, females are more likely than males to walk and, in most cities, more likely to use public transport. This relationship reverses in cycling, with females often less likely users than males. In high cycling cities, both genders are equally likely to cycle. Active travel to access public transport contributes 30--50{\%} of total active travel time. The gender differences in active travel metrics are age dependent. Among children (<{\thinspace}16~years), these metrics are often equal for girls and boys, while gender disparity increases with age. On average, active travel enables one in every four people in the population to achieve at least 30~min of physical activity in a day, though there is large variation across the cities. In general, females are more likely to achieve this level than males. The results highlight the importance of a gendered approach towards active transport policies. Such an approach necessitates reducing road traffic danger and male violence, as well as overcoming social norms that restrict women from cycling.}

There are seclusion norms that restrict the mobility of women outside the home. However, transport literature in India has not explored the impact of this lack of autonomy on gender differences in travel demand. I use 2019 population-representative nationwide time-use survey of India. The dataset reported both travel and non-travel activities for 30-minute episodes over a 24-hour period. For urban residents, I analysed gender differences in trip rates and mobility rates, where the latter is defined as the percentage going out of home at least once on the reporting day. I developed gender-stratified logistic regression models at the individual level with mobility as a binary outcome. It was found that 53\% of the females did not report going out of the home compared to only 14\% of males. The mobility of females reduces steeply from adolescence to young adulthood and then remains largely stable at a low level before reducing further for older adults. No such variation is observed among males, except their mobility is also reduced among older adults. There is a clear dichotomy with women mostly participating in in-house activities while men mostly involved in out-of-home activities. Adolescence or adulthood, marriage, living with one or more household members, having an infant in the house, lower income, and less education are associated with a lower likelihood of female mobility. The results highlight the need for gender-stratified analysis for transportation research, and a need for greater engagement across the disciplines of development economics, social sciences, and transport planning.}

Methods This ecological study involved 31 Asian countries. Dependent variables were AST prevalence, AST prevalence difference by age, and by sex. Independent variables were country-level environmental correlates extracted using publicly available datasets, classified into physical and social environments. Association estimates of each dependent variable and each of the independent variables were calculated using univariate linear regression. All variables were standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Results Results showed that 1 standard deviation (SD) difference in urban population percentage, night-time light, secondary-school enrolment, and prevalence of adult insufficient physical activity were negatively associated with AST prevalence (SD difference: -0.44 (-0.78 to -0.09), -0.40 (-0.76 to -0.04), -0.39 (-0.74 to -0.04), and -0.40 (-0.76 to -0.03), respectively). A 1 SD difference in car per people was associated with a -0.46 (-0.84 to -0.09) difference of AST prevalence by age. A 1 SD difference in PM2.5 concentration and of prevalence of adult insufficient physical activity were associated with a difference of 0.38 (0.01–0.74) and 0.42 (0.03–0.80) difference of AST prevalence by sex. Conclusions This study shows that Asian countries with a greater number of people living in urban areas, lower levels of overall adult physical activity and higher levels of night-time light have a lower prevalence of adolescent AST. Country-level physical and social environmental correlates explained some of the regional variance in AST. Future policy actions and interventions for the region need to be contextually sensitive to the environmental correlates that vary between countries.}

  abstract     = {Abstract Background Road Traffic injuries (RTI) are among the top ten leading causes of death in the world resulting in 1.35 million deaths every year, about 93\% of which occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite several global resolutions to reduce traffic injuries, they have continued to grow in many countries. Many high-income countries have successfully reduced RTI by using a public health approach and implementing evidence-based interventions. As many LMICs develop their highway infrastructure, adopting a similar scientific approach towards road safety is crucial. The evidence also needs to be evaluated to assess external validity because measures that have worked in high-income countries may not translate equally well to other contexts. An evidence gap map for RTI is the first step towards understanding what evidence is available, from where, and the key gaps in knowledge. Objectives The objective of this evidence gap map (EGM) is to identify existing evidence from all effectiveness studies and systematic reviews related to road safety interventions. In addition, the EGM identifies gaps in evidence where new primary studies and systematic reviews could add value. This will help direct future research and discussions based on systematic evidence towards the approaches and interventions which are most effective in the road safety sector. This could enable the generation of evidence for informing policy at global, regional or national levels. Search Methods The EGM includes systematic reviews and impact evaluations assessing the effect of interventions for RTI reported in academic databases, organization websites, and grey literature sources. The studies were searched up to December 2019. Selection Criteria The interventions were divided into five broad categories: (a) human factors (e.g., enforcement or road user education), (b) road design, infrastructure and traffic control, (c) legal and institutional framework, (d) post-crash pre-hospital care, and (e) vehicle factors (except car design for occupant protection) and protective devices. Included studies reported two primary outcomes: fatal crashes and non-fatal injury crashes; and four intermediate outcomes: change in use of seat belts, change in use of helmets, change in speed, and change in alcohol/drug use. Studies were excluded if they did not report injury or fatality as one of the outcomes. Data Collection and Analysis The EGM is presented in the form of a matrix with two primary dimensions: interventions (rows) and outcomes (columns). Additional dimensions are country income groups, region, quality level for systematic reviews, type of study design used (e.g., case-control), type of road user studied (e.g., pedestrian, cyclists), age groups, and road type. The EGM is available online where the matrix of interventions and outcomes can be filtered by one or more dimensions. The webpage includes a bibliography of the selected studies and titles and abstracts available for preview. Quality appraisal for systematic reviews was conducted using a critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews, AMSTAR 2. Main Results The EGM identified 1859 studies of which 322 were systematic reviews, 7 were protocol studies and 1530 were impact evaluations. Some studies included more than one intervention, outcome, study method, or study region. The studies were distributed among intervention categories as: human factors (n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}771), road design, infrastructure and traffic control (n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}661), legal and institutional framework (n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}424), post-crash pre-hospital care (n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}118) and vehicle factors and protective devices (n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}111). Fatal crashes as outcomes were reported in 1414 records and non-fatal injury crashes in 1252 records. Among the four intermediate outcomes, speed was most commonly reported (n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}298) followed by alcohol (n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}206), use of seatbelts (n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}167), and use of helmets (n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}66). Ninety-six percent of the studies were reported from high-income countries (HIC), 4.5\% from upper-middle-income countries, and only 1.4\% from lower-middle and low-income countries. There were 25 systematic reviews of high quality, 4 of moderate quality, and 293 of low quality. Authors' Conclusions The EGM shows that the distribution of available road safety evidence is skewed across the world. A vast majority of the literature is from HICs. In contrast, only a small fraction of the literature reports on the many LMICs that are fast expanding their road infrastructure, experiencing rapid changes in traffic patterns, and witnessing growth in road injuries. This bias in literature explains why many interventions that are of high importance in the context of LMICs remain poorly studied. Besides, many interventions that have been tested only in HICs may not work equally effectively in LMICs. Another important finding was that a large majority of systematic reviews are of low quality. The scarcity of evidence on many important interventions and lack of good quality evidence-synthesis have significant implications for future road safety research and practice in LMICs. The EGM presented here will help identify priority areas for researchers, while directing practitioners and policy makers towards proven interventions.}
