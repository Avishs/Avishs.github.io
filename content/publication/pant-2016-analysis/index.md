abstract: Size distributions of particulate matter and twelve constituent elements
  were measured at a high traffic site in New Delhi, India during winter 2013. While
  PM was found to be trimodal, individual elements showed varying size distribution
  patterns. Three key types of size distributions were observed including unimodal
  with peaks either in the coarse (Al, Si) or fine (Pb) modes, bimodal with peaks
  in the fine range (S) and multimodal with peaks in accumulation and coarse (Cu,
  Sb) modes. Elements such as Al, Si and Fe were found to be in predominantly in the
  coarse range while Cu, Zn, Pb and Sb were found to be in the fine size range. Two
  modes dominate the size distribution. One is coarse (ca. 3~ensuremathμm) and contains
  mainly crustal elements and hence arises from sources such as soil, road dust, construction
  dust and possible coal fly ash. The other, more intense mode is fine (ca. 0.6~ensuremathμm)
  and appears to comprise sulphate and anthropogenic trace metals which have entered
  the droplet mode through hygroscopic particle growth in the very high humidity conditions
  of the Delhi winter. A third, less intensive mode ca. at 0.2~ensuremathμm probably
  arises from relatively fresh anthropogenic emissions which have not grown into the
  droplet mode.
