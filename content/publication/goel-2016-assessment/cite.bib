 abstract = {Estimates of emissions and energy consumption by vehicular fleet in India are not backed by reliable values of parameters, leading to large uncertainties. We report new methods, including primary surveys and secondary data sources, to estimate in-use fleet size, annual mileage (kilometers per year), and fuel efficiency of cars and motorised two-wheelers (MTW) for Delhi, and except fleet size and annual mileage of cars, for Visakhapatnam and Rajkot. We estimated that the official number of registered cars and MTW in Indian cities is more than two times the actual number of in-use vehicles. The private vehicular fleet in India is the youngest, its fuel efficiency one of the highest, and annual kilometers travelled is the lowest, compared to many high-income countries, such as the USA and those in European Union. Along with high renewal rate of fleet, the data suggest that it is possible for India to have one of the most fuel-efficient vehicle fleets in the world in the future, if fuel-efficiency standards and fiscal policies to contain growing dieselization are implemented in the country at the earliest.},
