 abstract = {This article discusses how the perennial focus on policies to mitigate vehicular sources of air pollution in Delhi ignores a significant contribution by sectors other than transport. This works to the detriment of framing sustainable transport policies for the city. Such policies should not be dictated by the sole objective to reduce vehicular air pollution; that should rather be seen as a co-benefit within the larger gains of accessible and safe transportation system.},
