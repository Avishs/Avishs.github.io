abstract: We present details of access–egress as well as other travel characteristics
  of metro users in Delhi, and its satellite cities. For this study, we conducted
  an on-board survey of metro commuters (n=1112) in 2011. Survey respondents reported
  use of seven different modes to access metro stations, with 55% using non-motorized
  modes. The alternative modes reported by the respondents indicate that, in the absence
  of metro, a majority of commuters will use bus, and up to 40% will use private motorized
  modes. Up to 18% of the respondents may not have made the trips if metro was not
  available, indicating a significant proportion of induced trips. We used multinomial
  logistic regression models to understand the factors associated with the choice
  of access–egress modes, as well as alternative mode, for the current trip. Trip
  length, vehicle ownership, location of metro station (classified as administrative
  units within Delhi, and neighbouring cities), and population density around metro
  station have statistically significant associations with the choice of access/egress
  modes. Alternative modes of metro trips are found to be dependent on trip length
  and vehicle ownership. We found that up to 88% of metro trips have an interconnectivity
  ratio with the range of 0.2 to 0.5, with 0.4 as the mean, corroborating the results
  of [13] for a European setting. The results indicate that this ratio may be universally
  applicable, thus making it a robust parameter to assess, or forecast, ridership
  of public transportation systems.
