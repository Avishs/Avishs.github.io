abstract: Many transport planners consider urban population density to be a significant
  determinant of travel behaviour. Much of the evidence for this comes from research
  in low-density, high-income settings. The 2011 Census of India reported mode of
  travel to work and distance for the first time. We have used these data to investigate
  the effect of urban density on commute travel patterns at city-level for Indian
  cities. In addition, we investigated the relationship between travel behaviour and
  other city-level variables. Using regression, we found almost no independent effect
  of density on the mode share of walk, cycle, motorised two-wheelers, cars and public
  transport, after controlling for population and income levels for the cities. Further,
  it appears that once density levels are greater than ~80 persons per hectare (pph),
  other factors become more important in determining travel patterns in cities. This
  evidence has significant implications for urban planning and transport policy in
  Indian cities and for many other low- and middle-income cities where average density
  tends to be higher than ~80~pph. For these cities, growth in the use of sustainable
  transport may not depend on further densification of already dense cities, but on
  details of how neighbourhoods and streets are designed.
